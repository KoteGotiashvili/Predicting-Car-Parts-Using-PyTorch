# Deep Learning Model for Skin Cancer Classification (AWS Deployment) 

## This project tackles skin cancer classification using a deep learning model built with PyTorch. The model is trained to distinguish between nine distinct skin cancer classes with a dataset of approximately 2,300 images.

Key Technologies:

 * PyTorch: Deep learning framework for model development.

 * Matplotlib & Pandas: Data visualization and manipulation libraries.

 * Scikit-learn: Additional tools for data manipulation.

 * NumPy: For computation purpose.

 * MLflow & AWS: For Model Development and CI/CD pipelines.
